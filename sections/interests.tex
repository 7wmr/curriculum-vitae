\section{Interests}

A keen interest in a wide range of science and technology topics, 
this is fueled by a subscription to the New Scientist magazine as 
well as Kindle book reading. Other reading topics include 
Biographies, Military History and Science Fiction. \\~\\
I have a long term enthusiasm for running (ever since training 
to climb Mt. Cotopaxi, Ecuador when I was 17-years old). 
This is now mostly limited to local parks! \\~\\
I will be renewing my interest in sailing through a week-long 
course on the Isle of Wight this summer.
